        This website was made for CIS89C. It's got a bunch of pretty neat stuff. The creation of this website was intended to help me get better at web development. In this class, I will be doing some JavaScript thinggies to this website I think. Blah blah blah. I want a good grade, and lots of text makes this webpage look better. I made this place mostly black because black is a pretty neat color. Welcome to my website. Keep poking around and enjoy your stay!

      <p>
        This page also shows how some of the web elements are styled on this website. Check out some <a href="#">links</a> for you to click your heart out. And now, behold and despair at my list!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lean Pockets Pretzel Bread spinach and three cheese</li>
        <li>extra light tasting olive oil</li>
        <li>Friendly's Vienna mocha chunk ice cream</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        But we're not done yet. There are still many more elements to gaze upon.

        This should be a good &ldquo;why&ldquo; for my website. I shall end this page with a little poem I wrote.
      </p>
<pre>Once upon a sunset <span style="color:red">red</span>,
  Tomato <span style="color:red">Red</span> heard someone said,
    &ldquo;To stir her heart, her fire, her head&mdash;
      A rose of <span style="color:red">red</span> that said, &lsquo;To bed.&rsquo;&rdquo;

For Passion <span style="color:red">Red</span> did he outspread
  This present duly bred for <span style="color:red">red</span>.
    Alarmed and armed was Passion <span style="color:red">Red</span>;
      She stabbed the fruit! Left <span style="color:red">Red</span> for dead!

Such is the dread of Passion <span style="color:red">Red</span>
  Whose cherry many dreamed to wed.
    Pray laud the dead, disheart'nd, and <span style="color:red">Red</span>,
      For love had they not fled but bled.</pre>
